# Overview

Guessing number game in Erlang. I was learning Erlang to widen my languages and wanted to write a familiar game to show some of the main uses and syntax of Erlang. This program uses pattern matching within function parameters, recursion, guards and displaying output to the screen.
When the program is run you, the user, are able to play a guessing game. It chooses a random number between 1-100. You make an inital guess and it responds by telling you to either guess higher or lower. If/when you guess the correct number it tells you and tells you how many tries it took. (Friendly reminder that in Erlang you have to put a '.' after everything you want to execute, even in the command line!).

# Future Work

* It took me a long time to even feel like I had a small grasp on what was happening in Erlang, so I would really like to just be able to spend more time working with it in general. 
* I think it would also be fun to implement a list and pick a random number from the list each game play just to add something else to the game.
* Another idea I had, but not quite sure how I would make it work yet would be to have two players trying to guess the same number. You could take turns and you still see what their clue was and it is a race to see who can guess the right number.
